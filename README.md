## Hello there! 👋

I'm William Sandbrink.

Been writing spaghetti since 2015.
Fueled by ☕️ → 💻, chasing that dopamine hit of finally fixing a bug ⚡️.

### Ramblings

Mostly built full-stack apps that are now long gone (RIP hosting fees 😅).
Spent 2018–2020 deep in Django, dabbled with React since 2019, and now I’m in a love-hate thing with Go (probably Stockholm syndrome).
Recently picked up Rust 🙄, because no, I will not host a web-based CLI wrapper.

My thesis was on 5G URLLC security. Please don’t make me read another 3GPP report 🙏.
