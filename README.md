## Hello there! 👋

I'm William Sandbrink.

I've been writing spaghetti since 2015.  
I enjoy turning stimulants ☕️ into code 💻, and nothing gives me more dopamine than solving a problem I've wrestled with for days. ⚡️

### Ramblings

Apart from boring coursework (it was all basically simulators written in C, was never allowed to do anything on my own apart from a few courses), my projects have mostly been full-stack applications that are long gone and closed source (I didn't wanna pay for hosting 😅), however I've recently tried open sourcing my newer projects (so that recruiters can still see them without me having to host them).  
I basically spent the entirety of September 2018 – May 2020 working with Django (at the expense of my grades, except for programming courses 😎), while at the same time messing around with React from January 2019 – Present.  

Other than that I have a love-hate relationship with Go, based on old commit messages where I say I hate the language (must be Stockholm syndrome taking hold), and recently I picked up Rust (how original 🙄), since I absolutely refuse to host web-based CLI wrappers.  

My thesis was about the security aspects of URLLC in 5G, never make me read another 3GPP report again 🙏.
